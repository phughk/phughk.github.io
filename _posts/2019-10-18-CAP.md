I wanted to do a TL;DR; on the CAP theorem, because what distributed systems blog would this be without mentioning it.

In 1998, Eric Brewer proposed a theorem, that distributed systems must make tradeoffs and cannot provide all capbilities imaginable.
In particular, Brewer singled out 3 distinct areas that this tradeoff involves.

### Consistency
This is about making sure that events happening in your system can be acknolwedged by the entire system.
Or to quote [Wikipedia's entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem), your reads acknowledge the latest writes.

### Availability
This property implies that clients will receive a non-error response to their requests.

### Partition Tolerance
Systems that are partition tolerant can function and recover under terrible network conditions.

The premise is that you can only pick 2 of the above.
The plot twist is that if you don't have a system that is tolerant of partitions then you [don't really have a distributed system]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-10-18-PACELC %}).
You have a broken system.
