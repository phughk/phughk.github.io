I haven't posted music in a while.
This is a full recording of a not yet ready piece from Franz Liszt.
It is the 3rd piece in the series of three under the title "Liebstraume" which means dreams of love in German.
There are pauses when I am turning pages or when I am tryning to recover from the mistakes.
I recorded it in one take without retries - otherwise I would have ironed out the accidents.
