Decided to create a blog where I would throw some random ideas together about things that excite me about tech.
Perhaps do some explaining as well, TL;DR; style.
Then maybe chuck in some non-tech things because this isn't a "professional" blog and I don't want people thinking of it as such.

First up, how does one setup github pages with Jekyll?

1. Follow github instructions for a personal page
1. Follow Jekyll instruction for installing Jekyll
1. `jekyll new .` in project repo
1. Copy my [Gemfile](https://github.com/phughk/phughk.github.io/blob/master/Gemfile), it should only have 2 lines.
1. Verify things work locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Hope I saved you a few hours if you don't want to learn Ruby.
