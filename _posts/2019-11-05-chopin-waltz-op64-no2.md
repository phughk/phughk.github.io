I promised to throw some music on here, so here is me plonking out some Chopin.
At the moment I am obviously going to try to get the notes and rhythm right.
I intend to practice specific segments and describe how I practice in case others were wondering.

There isn't much to it, just repetition :)
But I will try to shed some insight if and when I do something that isn't only reptition.
