Hi there!
I'm an experienced senior software engineer with a diverse background in investment banking, commercial banking, and databases.
I'm currently working at SurrealDB, where I focus on optimizing database performance for large-scale applications.

In my free time, I love to run, read, play multiplayer games and board games, play the piano, and explore photography.
I also enjoy learning about art theory, machine learning, distributed systems research, and meditation.

Join me on my blog as I share my insights and perspectives on a wide range of topics.
I'm excited to engage in light-hearted and direct conversations that draw from my years of experience.
Let's learn and grow together!
