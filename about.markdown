![Profile](/assets/images/profile.jpg "Profile"){: .img-float-right}
Hi there! {% gif hello_there.gif %}

I'm an experienced senior software engineer with a diverse background in investment banking, commercial banking, and databases.
I'm currently working at SurrealDB, where I focus on optimizing database performance for large-scale applications.

In my free time, I love to run, read, play multiplayer games and board games, play the piano, and explore photography.
I also enjoy learning about art theory, machine learning, distributed systems research, and meditation.

Join me on my blog as I share my insights and perspectives on a wide range of topics.
I'm excited to engage in light-hearted and direct conversations that draw from my years of experience.
Let's learn and grow together!

Of course this bio was generated by ChatGPT.
But the rest of my content is written without GPT.
I do recommend Grammarly though :wink:.
